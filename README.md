This is a simple program to warp the mouse pointer to the center of the screen if it gets beyond a set range. This can help with remote viewer programs that don't do pointer lock very well, like SplashTop.

Run it on your local machine and place it on the monitor that will be running the remote program that needs pointer lock. When the cursor moves too far, it will warp back to the center. There will be a small jerk when the pointer moves to the center, but it mostly allows free scrolling.

Toggle with Shift+Backspace twice. This hotkey should be picked up by the local machine before SplashTop, allowing the warp to be turned on and off when using the remote viewer.
